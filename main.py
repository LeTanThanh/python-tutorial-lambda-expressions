  # What are Python lambda expressions

  """
  Python lambda expressions allow you to define anonymous functions.

  Anonymous functions are functions without names.
  The anonymous functions are useful when you neef to use them once.

  A lambda expression typically contains one or more arguments, but it can have only one expression.

  The following shows the lambda expression syntax:

  lambda parameters: expression

  It's equivalent to the following function with the "anonymous" name:

  def anonymous(parameters):
    return expression
